# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @sanim16 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @sanim16

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @sanim16 and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @sanim16 #This is an inline comment.

# In this example, @sanim16 owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
apps/ @sanim16

# In this example, @sanim16 owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
